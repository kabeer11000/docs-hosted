# Shepard tone explained

A **Shepard tone**, named after [Roger Shepard](../Roger_Shepard/), is a [sound](../sound/ "Sound is a vibration that propagates as an acoustic wave, through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or solid.") consisting of a [superposition](../superposition_principle/ "The superposition principle is the sum of the responses that would have been caused by each stimulus individually.") of [sine wave](../sine_wave/ "A sine wave is a continuous wave.")s separated by [octave](../octave/ "Octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with double its frequency.")s. When played with the bass [pitch](../Pitch_(music)/ "Pitch is a perceptual property of sound s that allows their ordering on a frequency -related scale, or more commonly, pitch ...") of the tone moving upward or downward, it is referred to as the _Shepard scale_. This creates the [auditory illusion](../auditory_illusion/ "Auditory illusion is processed with greater detail and accuracy in vision than in hearing.") of a tone that seems to continually ascend or descend in pitch, yet which ultimately gets no higher or lower.

## Construction

Each square in the figure indicates a tone, with any set of squares in vertical alignment together making one Shepard tone. The color of each square indicates the [loudness](../loudness/ "Loudness is the subjective perception of sound pressure.") of the note, with purple being the quietest and green the loudest. Overlapping notes that play at the same time are exactly one octave apart, and each scale fades in and fades out so that hearing the beginning or end of any given scale is impossible. As a conceptual example of an ascending Shepard scale, the first tone could be an almost inaudible C<sub>4</sub> (middle C) and a loud C<sub>5</sub> (an octave higher). The next would be a slightly louder C<sub>4</sub> and a slightly quieter C<sub>5</sub>; the next would be a still louder D<sub>4</sub> and a still quieter D<sub>5</sub>. The two frequencies would be equally loud at the middle of the octave (F<sub>4</sub> and F<sub>5</sub>), and the twelfth tone would be a loud B<sub>4</sub> and an almost inaudible B<sub>5</sub> with the addition of an almost inaudible B<sub>3</sub>. The thirteenth tone would then be the same as the first, and the cycle could continue indefinitely. (In other words, each tone consists of two sine waves with frequencies separated by octaves; the intensity of each is e.g. a [raised cosine](../raised_cosine/ "The raised-cosine filter is a filter frequently used for pulse-shaping in digital modulation due to its ability to minimise ...") function of its separation in [semitone](../semitone/ "A semitone is the smallest musical interval commonly used in Western tonal music, and it is considered the most dissonant ...")s from a peak frequency, which in the above example would be B<sub>4</sub>. According to Shepard, "(...) almost any smooth distribution that tapers off to subthreshold levels at low and high frequencies would have done as well as the cosine curve actually employed."<sup>[[1]](#Ref-1)</sup>

The theory behind the illusion was demonstrated during an episode of the BBC's show _[Bang Goes the Theory](../Bang_Goes_the_Theory/ "Bang Goes the Theory was a British television science magazine series, co-produced by the BBC and the Open University, that ...")_, where the effect was described as "a musical [barber's pole](../barberpole_illusion/ "The barberpole illusion is a visual illusion that reveals biases in the processing of visual motion in the human brain.")."<sup>[[2]](#Ref-2)</sup>

The scale as described, with discrete steps between each tone, is known as the **discrete Shepard scale**. The illusion is more convincing if there is a short time between successive notes ([staccato](../staccato/ "Staccato is a form of musical articulation.") or [marcato](../marcato/ "Marcato is a musical instruction indicating a note, chord, or passage is to be played louder or more forcefully than the ...") rather than [legato](../legato/ "Legato is required for slurred performance, but unlike slurring, legato does not forbid re- articulation.") or [portamento](../portamento/ "Portamento is a pitch sliding from one note to another.")).

## Variants

### Shepard-Risset glissando

[Jean-Claude Risset](../Jean-Claude_Risset/ "Jean-Claude Risset was a French composer, best known for his pioneering contributions to computer music.") subsequently created a version of the scale where the tones glide continuously, and it is appropriately called the **continuous Risset scale** or **Shepard–Risset glissando**.<sup>[[3]](#Ref-3)</sup> When done correctly, the tone appears to rise (or fall) continuously in pitch, yet return to its starting note. Risset has also created a similar effect with rhythm in which tempo seems to increase or decrease endlessly.<sup>[[4]](#Ref-4)</sup>

### Tritone paradox

See main article: [Tritone paradox](../Tritone_paradox/ "The tritone paradox is an auditory illusion in which a sequentially played pair of Shepard tone s separated by an interval ..."). A sequentially played pair of Shepard tones separated by an [interval](../interval_(music)/ "Interval is a difference in pitch between two sounds.") of a [tritone](../tritone/ "Tritone is defined as a musical interval composed of three adjacent whole tones.") (half an octave) produces the [tritone paradox](../tritone_paradox/ "The tritone paradox is an auditory illusion in which a sequentially played pair of Shepard tone s separated by an interval ..."). Shepard had predicted that the two tones would constitute a bi-stable figure, the auditory equivalent of the [Necker cube](../Necker_cube/ "The Necker cube is an optical illusion that was first published as a Rhomboid in 1832 by Swiss crystallographer Louis Albert ..."), that could be heard ascending or descending, but never both at the same time.<sup>[[1]](#Ref-1)</sup> In 1986, [Diana Deutsch](../Diana_Deutsch/ "Diana Deutsch is a British-American psychologist from London, England.") discovered that the perception of which tone was higher depended on the absolute frequencies involved, and that an individual would usually hear the same pitch as the highest (this is determined by the absolute pitch of the notes).<sup>[[5]](#Ref-5)</sup> Interestingly, different listeners may perceive the same pattern as being either ascending or descending, depending on the language or dialect of the listener (Deutsch, Henthorn and Dolson found that native speakers of [Vietnamese](../Vietnamese_language/), a [tonal](../Tone_(linguistics)/ "Tone is the use of pitch in language to distinguish lexical or grammatical meaning – that is, to distinguish or to inflect ...") language, heard the tritone paradox differently from Californians who were native speakers of English).<sup>[[6]](#Ref-6)</sup> <sup>[[7]](#Ref-7)</sup>

### Perpetual melody

Pedro Praticio observed in 2012 that by using a Shepard tone as a sound source and applying it to a melody he could reproduce the illusion of a continuously ascending or descending movement characteristic of the Shepard Scale. Regardless of the tempo and the [envelope](../Envelope_(music)/ "Envelope is controlled with four parameters: attack, decay, sustain and release.") of the notes, the auditory illusion is effectively maintained. The uncertainty of the scale the Shepard tones pertain allows composers to experiment with deceiving and disconcerting melodies.<sup>[[8]](#Ref-8)</sup>

## Examples

*   In a 1967 film by Shepard and E. E. Zajac, a Shepard tone accompanies the ascent of an analogous [Penrose stair](../Penrose_stair/ "The Penrose stairs is an impossible object created by Oscar Reutersvärd in 1937 and later independently made popular by ...").<sup>[[9]](#Ref-9)</sup>
*   The ending of the 1971 composition "[Echoes](../Echoes_(Pink_Floyd_song)/ "Echoes is a song by the English rock band Pink Floyd, and the sixth and final track from their 1971 album Meddle.")" from the album _[Meddle](../Meddle/ "Meddle is the sixth studio album by English rock band Pink Floyd, by Harvest Records.")_ by Pink Floyd features a Shepard tone that fades out to a wind sound (actually a white noise processed through a tape echo unit).<sup>[[10]](#Ref-10)</sup>
*   Queen's album _A Day at the Races_ begins and ends with a Shepard tone produced by a harmonium. (Album liner notes)
*   In his 1980 book _[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid](../G%c3%b6del%2c_Escher%2c_Bach/ "Gödel, Escher, Bach is a 1979 book by Douglas Hofstadter.")_, [Douglas Hofstadter](../Douglas_Hofstadter/) explained how Shepard scales could be used on the _Canon a 2, per tonos_ in [Bach's](../Johann_Sebastian_Bach/ "Johann Sebastian Bach was a German composer and musician of the late Baroque period.") _[Musical Offering](../Musical_Offering/ "The The Musical Offering is a collection of keyboard canon s and fugue s and other pieces of music by Johann Sebastian Bach, ...")_ (called the _Endlessly Rising Canon_ by Hofstadter<sup>[[11]](#Ref-11)</sup>) for making the [modulation](../modulation_(music)/ "Modulation is the change from one tonality to another.") end in the same pitch instead of an octave higher.<sup>[[11]](#Ref-11)</sup>
*   In 1995, Ira Braus argued the last notes of the 1885 piano work _[Bagatelle sans tonalité](../Bagatelle_sans_tonalit%c3%a9/ "Bagatelle sans tonalité is a piece for solo piano written by Franz Liszt in 1885.")_, composed by [Franz Liszt](../Franz_Liszt/ "Franz Liszt was a Hungarian composer, virtuoso pianist, conductor, music teacher, arranger, and organist of the Romantic era.") could be continued to produce a Shepard scale using Hofstadter’s technique.<sup>[[12]](#Ref-12)</sup>
*   In the video game _[Super Mario 64](../Super_Mario_64/ "Super Mario 64 was released in Japan on June 23, 1996 and later in North America and Europe in September 1996 and March ...")_ for the [Nintendo 64](../Nintendo_64/ "Nintendo 64 was discontinued in 2002 following the launch of its successor, the GameCube.") console (1996) there is a musical piece that incorporates a slightly modified Shepard scale played in the background when the player tries to climb the never-ending stairs located in the penultimate room of Peach's Castle. This auditory illusion complements the spacial loop effect seemingly giving the impression that the stairs never end.<sup>[[13]](#Ref-13)</sup>
*   In [Godspeed You! Black Emperor](../Godspeed_You!_Black_Emperor/ "Godspeed You! Black Emperor is a Canadian post-rock band which originated in Montreal, Quebec in 1994.")'s 1997 debut _[F♯ A♯ ∞](../F%e2%99%af_A%e2%99%af_%e2%88%9e/ "F♯ A♯ ∞ is the debut studio album by Canadian post-rock band Godspeed You! Black Emperor.")_, the opening song _The Dead Flag Blues_ has a section mainly consisting of tornado sirens using a Shephard tone to create its unique apocalyptic atmosphere.
*   On their 1998 album _[LP5](../LP5/)_, English electronic duo [Autechre](../Autechre/ "Autechre is an English electronic music duo consisting of Rob Brown and Sean Booth, both from Rochdale, Greater Manchester.") employed a decelerating Risset rhythm for the track "Fold4,Wrap5."
*   Austrian composer [Georg Friedrich Haas](../Georg_Friedrich_Haas/ "Georg Friedrich Haas is an Austrian composer.") includes the Shepard scale (at the end, among other moments) in his experimental orchestral piece _in vain_ (2000/02).<sup>[[14]](#Ref-14)</sup>
*   Christopher Nolan said in an interview that the soundtrack of his film _The Prestige_ (composed by David Julyan) explores the potential of Shepard tones as a fundamental basis for compositions.<sup>[[15]](#Ref-15)</sup>
*   In [Stephin Merritt](../Stephin_Merritt/)'s 2007 song "Man of a Million Faces", composed for [NPR](../NPR/ "NPR is based in two locations: main NPR headquarters in Washington, D.")'s "Project Song", the Shepard tone is a key aspect.<sup>[[16]](#Ref-16)</sup>
*   In the 2008 film _The Dark Knight_ and its 2012 follow-up _[The Dark Knight Rises](../The_Dark_Knight_Rises/ "The The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his ...")_, a Shepard tone was used to create the sound of the Batpod, a motorcycle that the filmmakers did not want to change gear and tone abruptly but to accelerate constantly.<sup>[[17]](#Ref-17)</sup>
*   In the 2017 film _[Dunkirk](../Dunkirk_(2017_film)/ "Dunkirk is a 2017 war film written, directed, and produced by Christopher Nolan that depicts the Dunkirk evacuation of World ...")_, a Shepard tone is used to create the illusion of an ever increasing moment of intensity across intertwined storylines.<sup>[[18]](#Ref-18)</sup>
*   In Lucrecia Martel’s feature film _Zama_ (2017) we find an extensive use of the Shepard tone creating a "loud and shreechy soundscape, in order to achieve closeness to the viewer", according to the director.<sup>[[19]](#Ref-19)</sup>
*   The 2018 track "[Always Ascending](../Always_Ascending_(song)/ "Always Ascending is a song by Scottish indie rock band Franz Ferdinand.")" by [Franz Ferdinand](../Franz_Ferdinand_(band)/ "Franz Ferdinand was composed of Alex Kapranos, Nick McCarthy, Bob Hardy, and Paul Thomson.") from the album of the same name features a rising Shepard tone throughout the song. The video for the song echoes the effect, with the camera apparently rising continually throughout.<sup>[[20]](#Ref-20)</sup>
